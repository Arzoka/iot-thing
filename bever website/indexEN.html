							<h2>The Beaver [tëmakwe in Munsee [teh-MAH-kweh]</h2>
							<p>For the Lenape the beaver was a special animal, because it was one of the animals that
								Kishelamàkânk helped create everything that consists of the silent, black
								nothing.
								Kishelamàkânk fell asleep in this void and dreamed of the world as we know it today,
								with everything that nature has to offer.
								The first time Kishelamàkânk created the earth did not go well, after which he created the
								spirit Nanapush sent to Earth to solve it.
								After a great flood everything was swept away and the animals he had saved left him
								help dig sand out of the sea to create a new island.
								The tortoise had offered to carry this land on his back, as the tortoise was on the
								water could float.
								The beaver was one of the animals that bravely tried to do this, but he came
								floating lifeless to the surface without the necessary land that the muskrat subsequently managed to find
								obtain.
								It is therefore not surprising that the beaver is so important to the Lenape, because it has itself
								sacrificed for the future of their new country and the existence of everything that came with it.

							<h2>The Lenape [Leh-NAH-Pay]</h2>
							<p>Lenape translated to “the people” was a collection of indigenous peoples living in, among other things
								the Delaware area and at the bottom of the Hudson.
								The women often cared for the small-scale agriculture on which they lived, and for the
								children and cooking.
								On the other hand, the men hunted game and caught fish from the rivers.
								Both husband and wife told many stories and made art and music all based
								on these stories and culture.
								Many of these stories were also based on the beaver wanting something specific
								Below is an example of such a story:
								The story of the beaver and the muskrat
								This story is about the contrast between the beaver and the muskrat and how their characters clash.
								The beaver is known for its industrious personality and checkers skills
								to build.
								In contrast, the muskrat is more opportunistic and less skilled.
								The purpose of this story is to shed light on collaboration and the importance of one
								strong community.
								The beaver is often used in stories to show how it helps conserve the
								environment and nature.</p>

							<h2>The Dutch Colonizers [Swanendael - [SWAH-nen-dahl]</h2>
							<p>Swanendael, or Zwaanendael means the valley of the swans.
								This was how the Lenape referred to the Dutch colonies, specifically the
								Dutch settlement founded in Delaware in 1631.
								In the year 1609 the VOC sponsored an expedition to America.
								The expedition arrived at the Hudson River, where the earthworks for the Dutch
								settlements were laid.
								Beavers were almost extinct in the Netherlands, but there were still many in America
								beavers to be found.
								In 1614 the first trading post was built near present-day Albany, New
								York.
								The trade in beaver skins soon caught on and the settlement was established around 1631
								the name for the Dutch colonies came from: Swanendael.
								Hunting for the Lenape was very different from the Dutch;
								The Lenape had respect for nature and its conservation and tried one here
								to find balance...
								The Dutch came up with new methods to catch as many beavers as possible
								pelts without considering the conservation of the beaver population.
								The Lenape still saw the beaver as a beaver, but the Dutch no longer saw the beaver as anything
								then a way to make money; a walking hat.</p>
